* Random read and write of randomly selected files.
*
* 'format=yes' first creates (depth*width*files) 1000 128k files.
* Test then will have eight threads each randomly select a file and do random
* reads.  After 'stopafter=100' reads the file is closed and a new
* file is randomly selected.
* An other eight threads will do the same, but only for writes.
*
* Note: the amount of files and the total combined file size in this test
* guarantees that most if not all of the i/o activity is done from cache.
* Increase the amount of files and/or the file size to make sure that some
* real disk i/o activity is done.
