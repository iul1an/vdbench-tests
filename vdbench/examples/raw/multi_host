* Multi-host, sequential write to two different disk files
*

hd=default,user=user,shell=rsh
hd=240a,system=240a.central.xyz.com
hd=240b,system=240b.central.xyz.com

sd=default,size=10g
sd=sd1,host=240a,lun=/home/user/junk/test.a40a
sd=sd2,host=240b,lun=/home/user/junk/test.a40b

wd=wd1,sd=sd*,seekpct=seq,xfersize=4k,rdpct=0

rd=rd1,wd=wd1,iorate=100,elapsed=5,interval=1

* - It is assumed that vdbench is installed on the remote system(s) in the same
*   place as it is on the host where you start this parameter file.
* - If not, add host=....,vdbench=/vdbench/dir
* - This example covers two hosts. Just add a new host= for each extra host,
*   and an other SD with a different file name.
* - Each host gets its own file name
* - Make sure you adjust the size to your liking
* - rd1 is a 100% sequential write, change it if needed.
* - When the end of the sequential file is reached Vdbench will start over at the beginning.
* - You may also adjust the iorate= and elapsed=
* - The first time you run this vdbench will first create and format these files
*   one at the time, and after that it will start running rd1.
* - Once the files exist with the proper length, the next runs will
*   immediately start with rd1.
* - Default remote startup is RSH, you can also code shell=SSH, user is
*   responsible for setting of the RSH/SSH environment.
* - If you don't have RSH or SSH you can code
*   hd=default,....,shell=vdbench (e.g. for Windows)
* - This then requires a one time start on the remote system of the
*   Vdbench RSH deamon: ./vdbench rsh
