*Example 4: Complex run, curves with different transfer sizes

sd=sd1,lun=/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0sx
wd=wd1,sd=sd1,rdpct=100
rd=run1,wd=wd1,io=curve,el=10,in=1,forx=(1k-64k,d)

*This generates 49 workload executions: 7 curve runs (one to determine max i/o
rate and 6 data points for 10, 50, 70, 80, 90, 100%) for 7 different transfer
sizes each. First 7 runs for 1k, then 7 runs for 2k, etc.

*Add 'forthreads=(1-64,d)', and we go to 7 * 49 = 343 workload executions.
This is why it is helpful doing a simulated run first by adding '-s' to your
execution: 'java vdbench -fparmfile -s'.
